Surfing the web or transacting on an unsecured Wi-Fi network means you could be exposing your private information and browsing habits. That’s why a virtual private network, better known as a VPN, should be a must for anyone concerned about their online security and privacy.

Think about all the times you’ve been on the go, reading emails while in line at the coffee shop, or checking your bank account while waiting at the doctor’s office. Unless you were logged into a private Wi-Fi network that requires a password, any data transmitted during your online session could be vulnerable to eavesdropping by strangers using the same network.

The encryption and anonymity that a VPN provides helps protect your online activities: sending emails, shopping online, or paying bills. VPNs also help keep your web browsing anonymous.

## What is a VPN?

A VPN (Virtual Private Network), as its name suggests, creates a virtual space for you to operate when you are online. It establishes a virtual point-to-point connection between the Internet and your device, sending your data through an encrypted tunnel. And it’s more important than ever for your digital privacy.

To help you understand it better, we’ll divide into 2 cases:

**Case 1: Your internet connection without a VPN**

When you browse the Internet, your Internet Service Provider (ISP) gives your devices an IP (Internet Protocol). This IP address uniquely identifies your device and lets it to send and receive information. However, regular internet connections are not encrypted.

Therefore, without a VPN, your IP address is exposed to the government, advertisers, data miners, even hackers, and thieves. Moreover, depending on your country’s legislation, they can track, monitor, store, and even sell your private data and browsing history.

**Case 2: Your internet connection with a VPN**

To counteract all of that online surveillance, you need a VPN. When using a VPN, your traffic goes through an encrypted tunnel. Your ISP only knows that you are connecting to a VPN server, but can’t see anything else anymore. Because the VPN hides your IP, no one can keep track of you.

So, there you have it. The VPN encrypts your data and adds a layer of security to protect your identity. Regardless of your location, you will be permitted to use the Internet as if you were present at the VPN’s location. This can be significantly beneficial for individuals using a public Wi-Fi network or hotspots (e.g., cafés, airports, or hotels).

Microsoft developed the first VPN in 1996 as a method for remote employees to access the company’s internal network securely. Once it doubled the productivity, other companies began adopting the practice. Corporate VPNs that allow remote work are a standard feature of the global business landscape nowadays.
