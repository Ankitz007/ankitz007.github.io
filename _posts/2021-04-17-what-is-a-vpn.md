Surfing the web or transacting on an unsecured Wi-Fi network means you could be exposing your private information and browsing habits. That’s why a virtual private network, better known as a VPN, should be a must for anyone concerned about their online security and privacy.

Think about all the times you’ve been on the go, reading emails while in line at the coffee shop, or checking your bank account while waiting at the doctor’s office. Unless you were logged into a private Wi-Fi network that requires a password, any data transmitted during your online session could be vulnerable to eavesdropping by strangers using the same network.

The encryption and anonymity that a VPN provides helps protect your online activities: sending emails, shopping online, or paying bills. VPNs also help keep your web browsing anonymous.

## What is a VPN?

A VPN (Virtual Private Network), as its name suggests, creates a virtual space for you to operate when you are online. It establishes a virtual point-to-point connection between the Internet and your device, sending your data through an encrypted tunnel. And it’s more important than ever for your digital privacy.

To help you understand it better, I’ll divide into 2 cases:

**Case 1: Your internet connection without a VPN**

When you browse the Internet, your Internet Service Provider (ISP) gives your devices an IP (Internet Protocol). This IP address uniquely identifies your device and lets it to send and receive information. However, regular internet connections are not encrypted.

Therefore, without a VPN, your IP address is exposed to the government, advertisers, data miners, even hackers, and thieves. Moreover, depending on your country’s legislation, they can track, monitor, store, and even sell your private data and browsing history.

**Case 2: Your internet connection with a VPN**

To counteract all of that online surveillance, you need a VPN. When using a VPN, your traffic goes through an encrypted tunnel. Your ISP only knows that you are connecting to a VPN server, but can’t see anything else anymore. Because the VPN hides your IP, no one can keep track of you.

So, there you have it. The VPN encrypts your data and adds a layer of security to protect your identity. Regardless of your location, you will be permitted to use the Internet as if you were present at the VPN’s location. This can be significantly beneficial for individuals using a public Wi-Fi network or hotspots (e.g., cafés, airports, or hotels).

Microsoft developed the first VPN in 1996 as a method for remote employees to access the company’s internal network securely. Once it doubled the productivity, other companies began adopting the practice. Corporate VPNs that allow remote work are a standard feature of the global business landscape nowadays.

## How a VPN protects your IP address and privacy?

VPNs essentially create a **data tunnel** between your local network and an exit node in another location, which could be thousands of miles away, making it seem as if you’re in another place. This benefit allows online freedom, or the ability to access your favorite apps and websites while on the go.

Here’s a closer look at how a virtual private network works. VPNs use encryption to scramble data when it’s sent over a Wi-Fi network. Encryption makes the data unreadable. Data security is especially important when using a public Wi-Fi network, because it prevents anyone else on the network from eavesdropping on your internet activity.

## VPN privacy: What does a VPN hide?

A VPN can hide a lot of information that can put your privacy at risk. Here are five of them.

### 1. Your browsing history

It’s no secret where you go on the internet. Your internet service provider and your web browser can track just about everything you do on the internet. A lot of the websites you visit can also keep a history. Web browsers can track your search history and tie that information to your IP address.

Here are two examples why you may want to keep your browsing history private. Maybe you have a medical condition and you’re searching the web for information about treatment options. Guess what? Without a VPN, you’ve automatically shared that information and may start receiving targeted ads that could draw further attention to your condition.

Or maybe you just want to price airline tickets for a flight next month. The travel sites you visit know you’re looking for tickets and they might display fares that aren’t the cheapest available.

These are just a few isolated examples. Keep in mind your internet service provider may be able to sell your browsing history. Even so-called private browsers may not be so private.

### 2. Your IP address and location

Anyone who captures your IP address can access what you’ve been searching on the internet and where you were located when you searched. Think of your IP address as the return address you’d put on a letter. It leads back to your device.

Since a VPN uses an IP address that’s not your own, it allows you to maintain your online privacy and search the web anonymously. You’re also protected against having your search history gathered, viewed, or sold. Keep in mind, your search history can still be viewed if you are using a public computer or one provided by your employer, school, or other organization.

### 3. Your location for streaming

You might pay for streaming services that enable you to watch things like professional sports. When you travel outside the country, the streaming service may not be available. There are good reasons for this, including contractual terms and regulations in other countries. Even so, a VPN would allow you to select an IP address in your home country. That would likely give you access to any event shown on your streaming service. You may also be able to avoid data or speed throttling.

### 4. Your devices

A VPN can help protect your devices, including desktop computer, laptop, tablet, and smart phone from prying eyes. Your devices can be prime targets for cybercriminals when you access the internet, especially if you’re on a public Wi-Fi network. In short, a VPN helps protect the data you send and receive on your devices so hackers won’t be able to watch your every move.

### 5. Your web activity — to maintain internet freedom

Hopefully, you’re not a candidate for government surveillance, but who knows. Remember, a VPN protects against your internet service provider seeing your browsing history. So you’re protected if a government agency asks your internet service provider to supply records of your internet activity. Assuming your VPN provider doesn’t log your browsing history (some VPN providers do), your VPN can help protect your internet freedom.

## How can a VPN help protect against identity theft?

Identity theft occurs when thieves steal your personal information and use it to commit crimes in your name — like taking over or opening new accounts, filing tax returns in your name, or renting or buying property. A VPN can help protect against identity theft by helping protect your data. It creates an encrypted tunnel for the data you send and receive that’s out of reach of cyberthieves.

If your smartphone's Wi-Fi is enabled at all times, your device could be vulnerable without you ever knowing it. Everyday activities like online shopping, banking and browsing can expose your information, making you vulnerable to cybercrime.

A VPN can protect the information you share or access using your devices. That’s especially important when using a public Wi-Fi network, where a cyberthief on the same network could capture your login credentials and the credit card number you type in when you shop online.

You can’t prevent identity theft. No one can. Some security aspects — like a data breach at an organization where you have an account — are out of your control. But a VPN can help safeguard the information you send from and receive on your devices.

## Conclusion

With virtual offices becoming more and more mainstream, VPN is becoming more and more important.

Honestly, using a VPN at work is the only reasonable thing to do as it keeps everything you do on the internet anonymous, just the way it should be.

With a VPN, you can protect your information from prying eyes and keep your online activity safeguarded.
