Technology today is evolving at such a rapid pace, enabling faster change and progress, causing an acceleration of the rate of change, until eventually, it will become exponential. However, it is not only technology trends and top technologies that are evolving, a lot more has changed this year due to the outbreak of COVID-19 making IT professionals realize that their role will not stay the same in the contactless world tomorrow. And an IT professional in 2020-21 will constantly be learning, unlearning, and relearning (out of necessity if not desire).  

What does this mean for you? It means staying current with new technology trends. And it means keeping your eyes on the future to know which skills you’ll need to know to secure a safe job tomorrow and even learn how to get there. So without further ado, let's get our hands dirty with the most trending technologies around the globe.  

## Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence, or AI, has already received a lot of buzz in the past decade, but it continues to be one of the new technology trends because its notable effects on how we live, work and play are only in the early stages. AI is already known for its superiority in image and speech recognition, navigation apps, smartphone personal assistants, ride-sharing apps and so much more.

The AI market will grow to [a $190 billion industry by 2025](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/artificial-intelligence-market-74851580.html) with global spending on cognitive and AI systems reaching [over $57 billion in 2021](https://www.idc.com/itexecutive/research/topics/ai). With AI spreading its wings across sectors, new jobs will be created in development, programming, testing, support and maintenance, to name a few. On the other hand AI also offers some of the highest salaries today ranging from over $1,25,000 per year (machine learning engineer) to $145,000 per year (AI architect) - making it the top new technology trend you must watch out for!  


## Edge Computing

Like the metaphorical cloud and the Internet of Things, the edge is a buzzword meaning everything and nothing. Over the years, we’ve seen paradigm shifts in computing workloads, going from data centers to the cloud and from the cloud to the logical edge of networks.

At its simplest, that’s what edge computing is: the processing and analyzing of data along a network edge, closest to the point of its collection, so that data becomes actionable.

It can exist “on the edge,” that is, closer to where computing needs to happen. For this reason, edge computing can be used to process time-sensitive data in remote locations with limited or no connectivity to a centralized location. In those situations, edge computing can act like mini datacenters.

Edge computing will increase as use of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices increases. By 2022, the global edge computing market is [expected to reach $6.72 billion](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/cloud-edge-computing-stats-you-need-know-2018-david-ricketts/). And this new technology trend is only meant to grow and nothing less, creating various jobs, primarily for software engineers.  


## CyberSecurity

Cyber security might not seem like trending technology, given that it has been around for a while, but it is evolving just as other technologies are. That’s in part because threats are constantly new. The malevolent hackers who are trying to illegally access data are not going to give up any time soon, and they will continue to find ways to get through even the toughest security measures. It’s also in part because new technology is being adapted to enhance security. As long as we have hackers, cybersecurity will remain a trending technology because it will constantly evolve to defend against those hackers.

The number of cybersecurity jobs is growing three times faster than other tech jobs, as proof for a serious need for cybersecurity professionals. But, the market is falling short of skilled people to fill in these positions. As a result, it’s predicted that there will be [3.5 million unfilled cybersecurity jobs by 2021](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2018/08/09/the-cybersecurity-talent-gap-is-an-industry-crisis/#3f5c78aca6b3).  


## Blockchain

Although most people think of blockchain technology in relation to cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, blockchain offers security that is useful in many other ways. In the simplest of terms, blockchain can be described as data you can only add to, not take away from or change. Hence the term “chain” because you’re making a chain of data. Not being able to change the previous blocks is what makes it so secure. 

In addition, blockchains are consensus-driven, so no one entity can take control of the data. With blockchain, you don’t need a trusted third-party to oversee or validate transactions.

An important Blockchain element- cryptocurrencies, will also be divided into several currencies and will be traded in the market on a high value.

77% of fintech firms are planning to adopt Blockchain as a part of an inside-production process by 2021.
According to a study, by the year 2025, the business value added by Blockchain will engage [more than $176 billion](https://puresoftware.com/the-4-biggest-technology-trends-to-watch-in-2020/), then rush to exceed $3.1 trillion by 2030.
Blockchain is growing at an aggressive rate due to which it is one of the significant technology trends in 2021. Blockchain’s futuristic technology is definitely here to stay!


## Augmented Reality

Augmented Reality or AR means adding a blend of digital elements to real-life through visuals. It is being explored for many applications, from entertainment to medicine and education.

It is one of the most fascinating top technology trends in recent years. It is something you could only imagine being part of Star Trek! Only now due to advanced innovations its being applied to real-life situations and possibilities.

The global AR and VR market is expected to [grow to $209.2 billion by 2022](https://techjury.net/blog/virtual-reality-statistics/#gref), only creating more opportunities in the trending technology, and welcoming more professionals ready for this game-changing field.

## Predictive & Personalized Medicine

Technology is moving medical care forward on an expanding rate. The potential to receive data about lifestyle from smartwatches (like Apple Watch, Fitbit, etc.) is providing medical professionals the ability to forecast and even treat possible health issues before a patient even has any symptoms.

In-fact, American insurance companies stated in early 2019, that they wish to stop selling traditional life insurance and will rather adopt interactive insurance schemes that can track data about fitness and health via wearable devices and smartphones.

This means the medical status of every customer will be tracked and considered by insurance companies only when the risks associated with their lifestyle and habits are determined.

When it comes to treating these patients, this technology trend will help doctors prescribe more personalized medicine, often referred to as predictive medicine. The info-driven understanding of how useful some treatments are on people will boost the healthcare market forward in 2021.

## Internet of Things

Multiple “things” are now emerging through WiFi connectivity, meaning they can be connected to the Internet—and each other. Hence, these things are called the Internet of Things, or IoT. The Internet of Things is the future, and has already enabled devices, home appliances, cars and much more to be connected to and exchange data over the Internet.

As consumers, we’re already using and benefitting from IoT. We can lock our doors remotely if we forget to when we leave for work and preheat our ovens on our way home from work, all while tracking our fitness on our Fitbits.

And we’re only in the beginning stages of this new technology trend: Forecasts suggest that [by 2030 around 50 billion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/802690/worldwide-connected-devices-by-access-technology/) of these IoT devices will be in use around the world, creating a massive web of interconnected devices spanning everything from smartphones to kitchen appliances. The global spending on the Internet of Things (IoT) is forecast [to reach 1.1 trillion U.S. dollars in 2022](https://www.statista.com/statistics/668996/worldwide-expenditures-for-the-internet-of-things/). 


## Conclusion

These top technology trends are gonna be the center of attention for the tech world as we expect 2021 to be a year of innovations and possibilities.

Hopefully, these new trends will bring positive and valuable results, offering promising career potential now and for the coming future. Is there anything exciting in the world of tech that was missed on this list? Feel free to express your ideas in the comment section below.
