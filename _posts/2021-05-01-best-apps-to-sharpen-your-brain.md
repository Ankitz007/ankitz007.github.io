Brain training is based on the premise that mental stimulation can improve neuroplasticity. This is the brain’s ability to form and reorganize connections between brain cells in response to new tasks.

A study[^study] published in PLOS One in 2013, for example, found that young adults who engaged in brain training games demonstrated improvements in brain processing speed, working memory, and executive functions.

It is not only young adults who might benefit from brain training. Research[^research] presented at the 2016 Alzheimer’s Association International Conference found that older adults who took part in ten 1-hour brain training sessions over a 5-week period were 48 percent less likely to develop cognitive decline or dementia over 10 years.

It is no secret that as we age, our brain function declines. However, studies have suggested that keeping mentally active – particularly when older – can help to maintain cognitive functioning. Brain training apps are considered a useful aid for mental stimulation, but which one is right for you? I present my pick of five of the best brain training apps I've played around.

## [Lumosity](https://www.lumosity.com/)

Considered by many as the “original” brain training app, Lumosity is used by **more than 85 million people** across the globe. The app consists of more than 50 colorful and fun minigames designed to train five cognitive functions: speed, memory, attention, flexibility, and problem-solving.

> Lumosity’s games have been created with the help of more than 100 researchers from around the world. Furthermore, their website cites a study of more than 4,700 adults that found that brain training with Lumosity improved cognition more than crosswords.

Once the games are complete, users are shown how their results compare with those of other users in the same age group. This provides insight into the areas of cognition that require the most attention.

Each day going forward, Lumosity sends a reminder to complete a brain “workout.” The daily brain workout involves playing three minigames – five with the premium version – each focusing on the five cognitive functions.


## [Left vs Right: Brain games for brain training](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mochibits.google.leftvsright&hl=en_US&gl=US)

Time to exercise each side of your brain! This app is brilliantly specific as it focuses more on the respective sides of your brain. Colours and patterns for your right side and numbers and logic for your left side.

It really helps you highlight the contrast between each side of your brain as well as helps you identify your strengths and weaknesses. There are so many games which are placed in a category base such as awareness, relax and patience. Hence it really gets your brain working not in terms of cognitive skills but also your overall mindfulness.

_With a rating of 4.5 on Play Store, Left vs Right is one hell of a popular brain trainer_

The app is available for free however has limitations on activities on a daily basis. You can try a 7-day trial on the full version and decide whether the limitations are sufficient for you to workaround. The app is available for both Andriod and IOS, so Lefties let your creativity flow and righties let your logic roll!


## [CogniFit](https://www.cognifit.com/)

CogniFit is perhaps the most advanced brain training app, consisting of a variety of minigames designed to train more than 20 cognitive skills, including short-term memory, planning, hand-eye coordination, and auditory perception.

The CogniFit developers are keen to point out that all of their brain training tools have been validated by scientists – including researchers from the University of Washington and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. Furthermore, they state that the efficacy of their tools has been established through [general population studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Novel+Television-Based+Cognitive+Training+Improves+Working+Memory+and+Executive+Function).

Interestingly, CogniFit also offers tools that researchers and healthcare professionals can use in order to study and assess cognitive function in patients.

Individual cognitive performance is assessed using the Lumosity Performance Index, which is calculated using the average scores of all games played. Like the other brain training apps, you can also compare your performance against that of other users.


## [Elevate](https://www.elevateapp.com/)

While Elevate has fewer users than Lumosity, at 10 million downloads worldwide, it holds the title of iPhone’s best app of the year for 2014. So what makes it stand out?

The app consists of more than 40 minigames designed to boost math and speaking skills, as well as improve memory, attention, and processing speed.

> According to the app’s creators, “the more you train with Elevate, the more you’ll improve critical cognitive skills that are designed to boost productivity, earning power, and self-confidence.”

Elevate has more of an adult feel than many of the other brain training apps; the minigames take a more serious approach, focusing less on colorful illustrations and more on text. Each game also comes with a brief description of its goal, such as “stop mixing up commonly confused words” and “improve your reading comprehension.”

Elevate provides a daily, weekly, and monthly rundown of overall performance, as well as performance in five specific areas: writing, listening, speaking, reading, and math. If you’re feeling competitive, you have the option of comparing your performance with that of other users in the same age group.

## [Peak](http://www.peak.net/)

Rated by Google as one of the best Android apps for 2016, Peak offers more than 30 minigames to help improve concentration, memory, mental agility, language, and problem-solving.

These games have been developed with the help of scientists from respectable universities across the globe, including Yale University in Connecticut and the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom.

> The Peak creators recommend brain training for 3 days per week. One great feature of Peak is that you can select the days that you want to train and set reminders for these days.

Based on performance in baseline tests, a personalized workout plan is provided, although the user is not limited to this plan. In the “Pro” version, all games are available to play at any time.

Cognitive performance is also very easy to track. Not only does the app provide information on individual game performance, but it also provides data on overall performance in each of the five cognitive functions. Similar to the other brain training apps, you are also able to compare performance with other users.


## Conclusion

Keeping a healthy mind is something we all strive to do, but it's not the just diet, sleep and exercise which are important. Regular mental activities, meditation and problem solving are essential for a sharper and active mentality.

The apps mentioned here are amazing at keeping your brain in tip-top shape and will really benefit your mental health.
