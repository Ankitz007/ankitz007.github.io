2020 was a strange year in all aspects. Who would’ve thought that the world would be struck by a pandemic and forced to retreat into their homes? Not me!

With many countries put into lockdowns and quarantines, the COVID-19 pandemic changed the face of the industry and paved the way for other ways of working. One of them was working from home and the formation of virtual workspaces.

Would you have ever imagined not commuting to work, sitting in the comfort of your home, wearing semi-formal clothes, and working? What a dream come true for employees! But as employers, you need the right tools to ensure that work is done in the same manner as before.

That’s where virtual workspaces come in! With so many tools out there replicating the entire office feel, you don’t need to worry about work from home affecting your workplace productivity anymore!

Let us take a look at the what’s and why’s of virtual workspaces. Let’s dive right in!

## Why are Virtual Workspaces Important?

Apart from the fact that virtual workspaces are great for working during these ghastly circumstances, there are plenty of other reasons why you should opt for virtual workspaces, COVID or not. Let’s have a look!

## Reduced Costs

With virtual workspaces, you can significantly reduce costs. This can include the costs of recruiting and supporting workers, like security costs, services, and equipment, transportation, in-office insurance, travel expenses for attending meetings or conferences, outsourcing costs, etc.

> Money saved = Money earned , right?

## Increased Scalability

When you work in a physical workspace, increasing the staff also involves moving to a larger office space. However, with a virtual team, you can easily scale your company up without thinking too much about how much more space you’ll need to accommodate your team.

What’s more? You also end up saving up the costs of electricity, heating, and air conditioning, etc.

## Increased Market Opportunities

Businesses, nowadays, are more inclined towards identifying and approaching global business opportunities. With virtual workspaces, you can employ workers from many places around the world, with potentially different languages, who are exposed to local markets.

These people, in turn, can help your organization build new business opportunities by tapping into their respective local markets and generate profits!

## Increased Net Profits

With so many expenditure cuts and expanded business opportunities, the net profit generated by companies that have virtual workspaces has been growing steadily.

Imagine no longer paying for things like the expense of buildings, leases, electricity, and water! That’s so much money being saved!

On the flip side, you can also expand your market globally and generate profits, which is a win-win situation!

## Environmental Benefits

As an added benefit, you also end up helping the environment as there is an elimination of transportation used by the employees which decrease emissions, and you also end up reducing your carbon footprint! It feels great to do your bit to save the planet, trust me!

## Conclusion

…and there you have it! With the help of these tools, you can easily enhance the productivity of your organization and ensure that work is happening just as it would in a physical workspace, with the added benefits! Sounds like a pretty sweet deal.
