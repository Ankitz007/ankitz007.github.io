The Bitcoin world is abuzz with both excitement and curiosity… and the opportunity for upside potential to skyrocket. Everyone from everyday Joes to reputable experts is betting on Bitcoin’s success.

It’s been a wild 13 years since Bitcoin’s release. Most notably, we’ve seen headlines of people who fortuitously purchased bitcoins early on turn into kid-millionaires. With the immense potential of new cryptocurrencies, our attention often turns to Bitcoin as a quintessential example of what’s to come.

I’ve designed this guide to teach you about Bitcoin so that you’re up to speed and ready to join the crypto-world.

## What is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin was introduced to the world in 2008 by someone who called himself “Satoshi Nakamoto”. He authored a paper titled **Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System**. Then, a few months later, the first Bitcoin software was released as open-source code. Shortly thereafter, the first Bitcoin transactions were recorded.

_Bitcoin is a new form of money that's completely digital._

> Released as an open-source software in 2009, Bitcoin is often credited as the world’s first cryptocurrency and is best defined as a digital currency that only exists electronically.

Bitcoin was designed to be a completely decentralized way to exchange money. Nakamoto argued in his paper that government-backed currencies were too dependent on trust, and that trust is easily broken. So he proposed a way to use cryptography to create a currency that could be used freely without needing to trust a central bank or government. 

## Why does Bitcoin exist?

_Inclusion of 3rd party was a necessity_

Until Bitcoin came around, you needed banks, credit cards, or companies like PayPal and Venmo to send and receive money. These companies were necessary to do something only they could do: verify that the person spending money actually has money to spend. Banks can do this because they hold everyone’s money, so they know all account balances.

**But what's so great about not using banks and credit card companies?** 
For starters, they are slow, expensive, and part of a broken financial system. Banks have huge costs for buildings, lawyers, and highly paid executives - all funded by the fees you pay (and massive taxpayer bailouts, like in 2008). Banks also limit how you can access and send your money.

_Bitcoin doesn't need a 3rd party_

Not needing a third party (like a bank) to handle accounts and transactions has a lot of benefits. Transactions can be faster and cheaper since there is no middleman.

Plus, your personal information becomes more private since no bank has to store it. You’re probably beginning to see why Bitcoin is such a game changer.

## How does Bitcoin work?

Now that you know what Bitcoin is and why it exists, let’s see how it actually works by a series of illustrations.

### Illustration 1

![BitcoinWorking1](/assets/img/bitcoin/bitcoinworking1.svg)
_Imagine four strangers sitting in a room, each with their own notebook. Because they are strangers, they don’t know or trust each other._

The four strangers in this example represent Bitcoin’s community of users. I am using strangers to explain this, because in the real world, most Bitcoin users do not know each other. The notebooks in this example represent what's called the Bitcoin Blockchain. The Blockchain stores a public record of every single bitcoin transaction ever made. The Blockchain is not on paper but 100% digital and public.

Most importantly, there are thousands and thousands of identical copies of the Blockchain held by users around the world. All these copies are kept in sync by the system that runs the Blockchain.  

### Illustration 2

_One stranger gives one bitcoin to another stranger. Now, EACH of the four strangers records this transaction. They then compare all their notebooks to make sure they match._

Just like in the example, when bitcoin is sent, the transaction is recorded on EVERY one of the thousands of copies of the Bitcoin Blockchain around the world. Each copy is an identical record of all transactions.

Just like notebooks were compared in the example, the Bitcoin system is constantly comparing all copies of the Blockchain to make sure they all have matching transactions.

### Illustration 3

_If all four notebooks match up, everything is fine. The transaction is approved by everybody._

If one notebook is different from the other three, we have a problem. It means one stranger is lying about the transaction. We also know which stranger is lying (hint: it’s the one with the notebook that doesn’t match the others). As a result, the three others ignore the notebook that doesn’t match and move on. The transaction is not approved.

_If one notebook is different from the other three, as a result, the three others ignore the notebook that doesn’t match and move on. The transaction is not approved._

The same two outcomes can happen with Bitcoin: If all Blockchain copies match, everything is fine and the transaction will proceed.

If one Blockchain copy is different from all others in the Bitcoin network, the network automatically rejects the transaction that doesn’t match the rest. This is what prevents fraud. It’s impossible for scammers to manipulate the system, since their Blockchain copy wouldn’t match what everyone else agrees on.

The technology that stores and constantly compares Bitcoin’s “notebooks” to make sure they are all identical is called the **Blockchain**.

_Blockchain as a Ledger_

Bitcoin’s Blockchain is the technology that allows strangers to work together to exchange money without trust. This means no middlemen like banks are needed.

Instead of recording transactions in private record systems like a bank or credit card company does, Bitcoin users record ALL transactions at the SAME TIME in IDENTICAL copies of the Blockchain. As a result, any attempt to fool the system would be noticed as obviously different and rejected by the system.

_Concept of "Finding a consensus" in Blockchain_

This method of comparing all the identical “notebooks” is called finding a “consensus” - in other words a mutual agreement that the transaction isn’t fraud.

Bitcoin uses the same strategy to compare all transactions on the Blockchain. It can do this very quickly by using powerful computer code. The process of comparing transactions using this computer code is known as Bitcoin’s Consensus Algorithm.

## How to buy Bitcoins?

In the early years of Bitcoin it was difficult to find a trustworthy place to buy the cryptocurrency specially for those who didn’t know how to buy bitcoin.  With the increase in demand for Bitcoin, numerous new companies have sprouted to help facilitate easily purchasing Bitcoin.

### Buy on an Exchange

_Bitcoin listing on different Exchanges_

Many marketplaces called “bitcoin exchanges” allow people to buy or sell bitcoins using different currencies. Coinbase is a leading exchange, along with Bitstamp and Bitfinex. But security can be a concern: bitcoins worth tens of millions of dollars were stolen from Bitfinex when it was hacked in 2016.

### Transfers

_Person-to-Person transfer_

People can send bitcoins to each other using mobile apps or their computers. It’s similar to sending cash digitally.

### Mining

_Mining Bitcoin with heavy computational resources_

People compete to “mine” bitcoins using computers to solve complex math puzzles. This is how bitcoins are created. Currently, a winner is rewarded with 6.25 bitcoins roughly every 10 minutes.


## Conclusion

Bitcoin is still a relatively young currency but it has achieved substantial user adoption and growth. Bitcoin’s network only grows stronger as more people obtain a bitcoin ATM service to learn about Bitcoin’s fundamental technology and potential in relation to other methods of value storage.

As the flagship of the cryptocurrency fleet, Bitcoin is considered the “gateway” cryptocurrency. Understanding Bitcoin’s potential is an essential first step to seeing the brilliant solutions being worked on in the cryptocurrency world.

_Brace yourselves. Cryptos are coming._

Bitcoin paints a future that is drastically different from the fiat-based world today. This is either exciting or unsettling for the vast majority. Equip yourself with the best possible resources. Become active in communities that further explore not only the technical applications of Bitcoin and other cryptos but with their overall potential to disrupt virtually every market.
