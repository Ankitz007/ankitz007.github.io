![About banner](/assets/img/about_banner.png)

I am an undergraduate student at R.V. College of Engineering, Bengaluru pursuing my Bachelors in Information Technology. I am passionate for Front-End Web Design and have extensive experience working with Deep Learning Models as well. I am always eager to learn and adapt to different environments.  

I can usually be found doing two things:
- Binge watching TV-shows/movies, or
- Coding (Learning as of now üòúÔ∏è).

**Well, not exactly, but you get the idea, right? üòÇÔ∏è**



Ever since I was a little kid, software development has been my passion. I still remember sitting in front of a computer, with the BASIC cartridge loaded in, making it print "Hello, Ankit" for the very first time. As I went through the BASIC tutorial, it was almost magic, being able to get the computer to do whatever I wanted, just by typing in these funny little symbols, limited only by my own imagination and ingenuity. Throughout middle and high school, I latched on to any ideas for projects I could get, moving from "Hello World" all the way to my own blog, with dozens of projects in between. I learned C, then C++, tearing through any books I could find on anything remotely related to software development. I was insatiable.

This passion carried me through my education at college level as well. Here there were more resources available to me than I ever could have imagined as a kid. I studied new languages, algorithms, compilers, higher mathematics, all with pretty much the same fascination that drove me as a kid. And it was here that I learned truly how much there was yet to learn.

So, now, in industry, this passion remains with me. There's certainly yet more to learn, yet more problems to solve, and yet more to build. And for this, I am very grateful.
